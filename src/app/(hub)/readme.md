include author / maintainer column

maybe have subrouting for /hub/classification, /hub/segmentation, /hub/pose_estimation etc.

add plotly visualization which works with the checkboxes next to the models in the chart.

add a form or option to report a bug / request a feature. have dropdown of "improve interface, new feature, bad link, incorrect information, other" etc.

figure out the differences between yolov5-cls, yolov5, yolov5-seg, yolov56 (p6) and whether they're p5, p6

"We trained YOLOv5-cls classification models on ImageNet for 90 epochs using a 4xA100 instance"
"We trained YOLOv5 segmentations models on COCO for 300 epochs at image size 640 using A100 GPUs"

look at: https://paperswithcode.com/sota/real-time-object-detection-on-coco for model ideas after doing yolo models

see: 
- https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 (looks like it has p5 and p6 models, also the cls models )
- https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases (v7.0 has segmentation models)
